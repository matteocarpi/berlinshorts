  "conceptContent": "The first edition of Berlin Shorts aims at the diffusion of original cinematographic works, with a maximum duration of 40 minutes. Because of their nature and for- mat, those cinematographic works often struggle to find space in theaters or on television and need a dedicated event to be disclosed. We consider Berlin, being a great melting pot where different cultures and young talents from all over the world meet, as a fertile ground for cinema and art. The city hosts a great number of talented filmmakers, whose works havenâ€™t found (not yet) the right space to be shared and appreciated. This festival is conceived as a cultural event with the aim of showing movies and creating a meeting point between cinema lovers and professionals. Berlin Shorts would like to offer a space to exchange thoughts, comments and critics on selected films and to put in touch people who already do or want to make films. The atmo- sphere that we would like to create within this festival is that of a cosy living room, where everyone feels free to exchange opinions without fear of judgment. The philosophy of our festivals is that every work submitted to us will be watched from the beginning to the end by our selectors and only the best shorts will be selected.",
