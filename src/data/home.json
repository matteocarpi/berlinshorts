  "slogan": "An evening of shorts from all over the world",
  "mission": "The first edition of Berlin Shorts aims at the diffusion of original cinematographic works, with a maximum duration of 40 minutes. Bacause of their nature and for- mat, those cinematographic works often struggle to find space in theaters or on television and need a dedicated event to be disclosed.",
  "cinema": "A lot has happened from the 20th of December 2011, the date when Verena first stepped into the building that would eventually become Wolf, to what will be our official opening on the 25th February, that has taken what was once a disused and crumbling space and turned it into a cinema. Those years have been filled with an unimaginable energy and continued commitment from an innumerable amount of people whose combined efforts have finally pushed Wolf into existence.",
  "varco": "We take the time to listen, so others feel comfortable to be themselves, and supported to succeed. We’re always thinking ahead, figuring out how to make the most purposeful impact. Have fun, together. We are united in our determination to create meaningful change, taking pride in making long-lasting impact.",
