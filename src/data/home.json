  "slogan": "Two days of shorts from all over the world",
  "mission": "The first edition of Berlin Shorts aims at the diffusion of original cinematographic works, with a maximum duration of 40 minutes. Bacause of their nature and format, those cinematographic works often struggle to find space in theaters or on television and need a dedicated event to be disclosed. \nWe consider Berlin, being a great melting pot where different cultures and young talents from all over the world meet, as a fertile ground for cinema and art. The city hosts a great number of talented filmmakers, whose works haven’t found (not yet) the right space to be shared and appreciated.",
  "lilian": "Is a director and screen writer. She lived in Berlin for 5 years and lives now across rome and Berlin looking for new stories to tell.",
  "matteo": "Is a theatre maker and actor. He’s based in berlin but travels with his theatre company around festivals.",
  "varco": "We take the time to listen, so others feel comfortable to be themselves, and supported to succeed. We’re always thinking ahead, figuring out how to make the most purposeful impact. Have fun, together. We are united in our determination to create meaningful change, taking pride in making long-lasting impact."
